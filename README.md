Analysis of a dataset of traffic incidents using Spark SQL and graphs

Which traffic incidents occur most frequently? What age group is most involved in traffic incidents? What is the most common event in incidents? Are passengers or pedestrians the main victims of incidents?

These and other questions are the focus of our analysis, where we aim to provide insights through the examination of publicly available real data. In this project, we utilized Apache Spark to efficiently read and process the data, simulating data processing in a distributed cluster of computers. Apache SQL was employed to manipulate and query the data for further analysis. Additionally, we leveraged the power of Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib to create informative and visually appealing graphs to visualize our findings.
