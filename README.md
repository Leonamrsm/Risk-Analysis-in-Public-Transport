# Risk-Analysis-in-Public-Transport
Analysis of a dataset of traffic incidents using Spark SQL and graphs

Which traffic incidents occur most frequently? What age group is most involved in traffic incidents? What is the most common event in incidents? Are passengers or pedestrians the main victims of incidents?

These and other questions are the focus of analysis in this project, where we provide insights through the examination of publicly available real data (link). In this project, Apache Spark was used to read and process data efficiently, simulating data processing in a distributed cluster of computers. Apache SQL was employed to manipulate and query the data for further analysis. In addition, we leverage the power of Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib to create informative and visually engaging graphs to visualize findings.

For the construction of this project, the dataset available for download at the link below was used:
